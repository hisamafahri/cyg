# cyg

Secure files in your repository. The name "cyg" was inspired by the [Cygnus constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)).

## How It Works?

The current version of this tools are wrapping the already existing and secure [GnuPG CLI](https://gnupg.org/).

Make sure it already installed in your system by running:

```bash
  gpg --version
```

It should return the version installed in your system.

## Usage
